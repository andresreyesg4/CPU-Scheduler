# CPU-Scheduler
This project simulates a CPU-Scheduler, specifically the Earliest Deadline First. This alrogithm is preemptive which means that it will make a new decision
everytime there is an interrupt for Created, I/O/, ready, Stopped, and Terminated. This project reflects on how the CPU selects a new process to run for 
one unit time.
